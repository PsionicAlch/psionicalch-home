          My love for programming has resulted in me trying out almost every
          programming language and web framework under the sun. I used Laravel,
          ReactJS, InertiaJS, Typescript, PHP, and TailwindCSS for <a

            target="_blank"
            class="hover:underline font-medium">Brandable Domains</a
          > and this website was made using Astro, VueJS, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.
          I am also really good at learning new technologies so I'd be capable of
          building your vision in whatever you want to use.

          also the entire environment on which my projects run. Luckily for me I
          also really love the Linux operating system so it's a match made in heaven.

        <p class="text-justify">
          It's a common issue in the software development space that the
          software I wrote and ran on my system doesn't run on your system.
          There are a lot of running parts in the software development process
          and it's hard to always keep track of everything. So for my personal
          development and production use cases I love to use Docker. Docker
          allows me to ensure that if it runs on my laptop it will also run on
          my VPS and even on my client's computer. I personally run <a

          Brand Domains was my first in a lot of ways. This was my first
          production application that I released into the world for people to
          use as they see fit. This was also my first venture in to the world of
          prompt engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I made and released
          Brand Domains in one week of intense development. It taught me a lot
          about how to create an appealing user interface that I enjoyed to look
          at and which I could be proud of. It taught me how to use Laravel,
          InertiaJS, and ReactJS which was really eye opening because before
          this project I used to make applications where the frontend would be
          completely decoupled from the backend. I always used to think that if
          I decoupled the server from the user interface it would allow me to
          optimise the individual parts without needing a full system rewrite
          but that also meant that I spent a lot of time writing a complex API
          (Application Programming Interface) to make the two halves of the
          application work together. InertiaJS showed me an easier way to make
          my backend and frontend work together. With this project I got to
          learn how to run a server in production. I got to set up my first
          firewall to ensure I control how the outside world is allowed to
          interact with my server and to keep the outside world from directly
          accessing my internal docker containers. I also got the opportunity to
          host a third-party anonymous analytics framework on my VPS (Virtual
          Private Server) so that I can stay in full control over my user's data
          (not that there is any sensitive data but it's still a lesson).
